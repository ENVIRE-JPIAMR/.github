# ENVIRE
[Research Consortium ENVIRE](https://www.envire-project.de/): Interventions to control the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance from chickens through the environment.

The research project ENVIRE consists of an international consortium of researchers in France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland and Tunisia. The project runs from 2022 to 2025 and is part of the European Transnational Programme “One Health interventions to prevent or reduce the development and transmission of antimicrobial resistance” (JPIAMR-ACTION). The respective national funding bodies fund the consortium.

The overall objective of the project ENVIRE is to contribute to the reduction of the selection and the spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in broiler chickens and from chicken farms to the environment, and ultimately to humans.
