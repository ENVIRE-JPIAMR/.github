## Directory setup
This parent directory needs to be initialized with two elements: 
- `here` package preinstalled
- an empty file with extension `.here`
- a script `init.R` consisting

  ```
  library(here)

  here::i_am('init.R')  
  ```
### Then run the command to initialize the repositories

  ```
  source("init.R")
  ```
